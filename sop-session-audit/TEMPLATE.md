```markdown
# [Feature Name]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Summary

[2-3 sentences: what was implemented and why]

## What We Did

- [Change 1 with file path if relevant]
- [Change 2]
- [Change 3]

## Key Design Decisions

**[Decision 1]**: [What was decided]

## Important Feedback

Capture the **conversation flow**, not just the end result. Show the **progression of corrections** that shaped the session.

**Style A - Numbered interactions** (for sessions with many back-and-forth exchanges):
1. **"[user quote]"** - [context and what happened]
2. **[event]** - [what I did and outcome]
3. **"[user quote]"** - [what this led to]

**Style B - Detailed corrections** (for sessions with significant course changes):
### Feedback 1: [Topic]
**User said:** "[direct quote or paraphrase]"

**What I was doing wrong:** [explanation of the mistake]

**Correction:** [what changed as a result]

(If no significant feedback: "None - straightforward session")
